## Web Application

This application will provide the snack list, a description and the user that we will be assigning the snack to. We have
the ability to update the snacks in all fields, along with deleting the snacks and navigating to all the pages. 

The web application consists of a frontend written in HTML and Django. The backend was written in Python.

This project is meant as a starting point of the snacks application to build on knowledge of Django and CRUD application.
There is a template for a CustomUser that has been built in and the visuals for this application are being implemented 
by Tailwind CSS.
